My mom Chan Mee King was 72 when she told me on our 1999 Mother-Daughter trip to China,  one of the Best decisions I ever made, waving goodbye to her cousins in her village in Luk Tun, she turned to me and said “I am the only G.I. bride from my village”, my mom’s phrase of Hope and Promise, not of War.  

My mom is the inspiration for my project titled Our Moms, Chinese G.I. War Brides presentation on November 8, 2023 through the Bay Area Chinese Genealogy Group in the San Francisco Bay Area.    

We have been invited back in Spring 2024 to do another presentation for those who were unable to attend on November 8th and for those who want to learn more about their moms.   The GI Brides topic is so new and first of its kind.  Documents, more Brides' stories, a story or two on the 589 children who came in under the 1945 WB Act?  There are other forms of documents I was privileged to see from our In-Person attendees or in emails about your moms.   A round table discussion group where participants bring their Bride's documents for show n' tell? 

Gene Chin is one of the 589 children who entered the U.S. under the 1945 War Brides Act.  Gene graciously shared his story of coming over with his dad and mom along with 6 other families, a journey of their boat towed up the river from Hong Kong to board the SS Marine Swallow in Shanghai.  Coming under fire from Chinese bandits.  A journey taking months before arriving at port of San Francisco, July 15, 1946.  

Sharing a quote from Diana Lew:  "All (my mom) she had to do after her name was called to board the ship was just say, “G. I. Wife,” probably among her first words of English."

We collected 55 Chinese G.I. Brides names for an Honor Roll slide to honor our moms at our presentation 

Not every story, the same, Not every journey, the same.
