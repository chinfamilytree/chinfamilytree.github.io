	<p>A copy of the 
<a href="VongTun.pdf" target="_blank"><b> 1994 Manuscript </b></a>
of Huang Village Chin Family Tree was given to me by 宗能叔 (Chĩn Düng Nãng aka Ching Dong Lum) in 1995. This manuscript provided the foundation for this entire endeavor. Without this manuscript this online project would not have been possible. My sincere thanks to him and his family.
	</p>
	<p>The first page of the manuscript says it was copied in 1994, hence its name, 1994 Manuscript,  but it does not say from where or by whom.

In 2023 陳俊榮 (Chĩn Dün Vẽin, aka John W. Chin), first son of 晃斌哥 (big brother Fōng Bïn, aka Bin Fong Chin) provided the <a href="VongTun1892.pdf" target="_blank"><b> 1892 Manuscript </b></a> 
named 潁川堂陳氏族譜潢村海清里

John found this manuscript among his father's papers, unknown as to how he had obtained it and who photocopied it for him.
	</p>
	<p>
This manuscript was written in 1892 by 陳業勳 Chĩn Ngèp Fün (1866-1898), where the later generations were specific to the Northward Hamlet of Vong Tun.
	</p>
	<p>
陳業勳 Chĩn Ngèp Fün's wife was 鄺氏 Föng Sì <i>Kuàngshì</i> from the Clan Föng (1870-1896), the daughter of 鄺熀德 Föng Fōng Āk <i>Kuàng Huǎngdé</i> of 沖雲三里樂 Chüng Vũn Xâm Lî Lòk <i>Chōng Yún Sān Lǐ Lè</i>. She gave birth to three sons: 湛光 Jäm Göng <i>Zhànguāng</i> (1890-1893), 任光 Ngĩm Göng <i> Rènguāng</i> (?-?) and 錦泉 Gīm Tũn <i>Jǐnquán</i> (1894-?). Posthumously, he had an adopted son named 伯樂 Bâk Lòk <i>Bólè</i> who was born on 1910.

The information enclosed in parentheses are my notes/comments. Here is <a href="page25upright.png" target="_blank">Page 25</a> (turned right side up). I have connected eight of the entries to the village progenitor There are some  grandsons and great-grandsons and four sons (number 1, 2, 3 and 5), all of which were from Chen Fengtai's first wife. His second wife had 3 sons, number 4, number 6 and number 7. Anyone with information on the other five entries are most welcomed. Please email me. Thank you.
