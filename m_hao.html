<p>
In reference to a name of a person, a 號 hào <i>hào</i> is, in general, a nickname or pseudonym. However in the South, especially in Guangdong Province, it is a "marriage name" or perhaps a better English translation would be "generation name" bestowed upon a groom when he is married and a plaque is placed in the village temple. Henceforth he is known by that name. The general order of a 號 hào <i>hào</i> is the surname, which is always first, followed by two characters, one of which is from the village <a href="m_generation-poem.html">generation poem</a> and the other character is chosen by an elder, either the groom's father or grandfather, or another village elder.
