<div class="ex2"><h3 id="hao">Generation Poem</h3>

<p>
A generation poem is village-dependent. Our Vong Village 潢村, consisting of five hamlets has its own unique poem. The first 20 characters of the 陳文起 Chin Mun Hi <i>Chen Wen Qi</i> branch were written by 陳白沙 (陳獻章) Chen Bai Sha (1428-1500 CE) for 陳謨 Chen Mo’s fourth son 陳文起 Chin Mun Hi <i>Chen Wen Qi</i> starting from the 13th generation through the 32nd generation: <br>
聖文萬世昌。 Eminent classical literature will prosper for many generations<br>
應朝瑞國祥。 In response to an auspicious dynasty and the kindness of a nation.<br>
德業光前遠。 The honor of moral conduct and achievement will shine into the distant future.<br>
遵法永延長。 Obeying the law will be protracted forever. 
</p>
<p>
The second 20 characters were written by 陳伯陶 Chen Bo Tao (1854-1930 CE) as a continuation of Chen Bai Sha’s poem for the next 20 generations until the 52nd generation: <br>
仁厚承恩澤。 Benevolence and generosity will be graciously extended to the people.<br>
書香啟俊良。 A literary atmosphere will enlighten the talented and conscionable people.<br>
邦家常有耀。 The glory of one's fatherland will be dazzling.<br>
續學自名揚。 Continuous study will develop one's fame.<br>
</p>
<p>
These generation names were not strictly followed. There were some people in the 陳文起 Chin Mun Hi <i>Chen Wen Qi</i> branch who used 文 Mun <i>Wen </i> instead of 德 Ak <i>De</i> for the 23rd generation. This character came from the generation poem used by the 陳文振 Chin Mun Jin <i>Chen Wen Zhen</i> (陳謨 Chen Mo’s second son) branch. This branch's generation poem starting at the 13th generation is 藉鳳毓嘉秀。 和敬發賢良。 文明應顯達。 歷世永傳揚。
