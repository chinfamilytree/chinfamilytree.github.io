<p>
In reference to a name of a person, it is, in general, a nickname or pseudonym. However in the South, especially in Guangdong Province, it is a "marriage name" bestowed upon a groom when he is married and a plaque is placed in the village temple. Henceforth he is known by that name. One of the characters in a marriage name comes from a generation poem for that village. <i>More to come later.</i>
