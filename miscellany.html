<div class="ex2"><h3 id="hao">What is a 號 hào?</h3>
<p>
In reference to a name of a person, a 號 hào <i>hào</i> is, in general, a nickname or pseudonym. However in the South, especially in Guangdong Province, it is a "marriage name" or perhaps a better English translation would be "generation name" bestowed upon a groom when he is married and a plaque is placed in the village temple. Henceforth he is known by that name. The general order of a 號 hào <i>hào</i> is the surname, which is always first, followed by two characters, one of which is from the village generation poem and the other character is chosen by an elder, either the groom's father or grandfather, or another village elder.

A generation poem is village-dependent. Our Vong Village 潢村, consisting of five hamlets has its own unique poem. The first 20 characters of the 陳文起 Chin Mun Hi <i>Chen Wen Qi</i> branch were written by 陳白沙 (陳獻章) Chen Bai Sha (1428-1500 CE) for 陳謨 Chen Mo’s fourth son 陳文起 Chin Mun Hi <i>Chen Wen Qi</i> starting from the 13th generation through the 32nd generation: <br>
聖文萬世昌。 Eminent classical literature will prosper for many generations<br>
應朝瑞國祥。 In response to an auspicious dynasty and the kindness of a nation.<br>
德業光前遠。 The honor of moral conduct and achievement will shine into the distant future.<br>
遵法永延長。 Obeying the law will be protracted forever. 
</p>
<p>
The second 20 characters were written by 陳伯陶 Chen Bo Tao (1854-1930 CE) as a continuation of Chen Bai Sha’s poem for the next 20 generations until the 52nd generation: <br>
仁厚承恩澤。 Benevolence and generosity will be graciously extended to the people.<br>
書香啟俊良。 A literary atmosphere will enlighten the talented and conscionable people.<br>
邦家常有耀。 The glory of one's fatherland will be dazzling.<br>
續學自名揚。 Continuous study will develop one's fame.<br>
</p>
<p>
These generation names were not strictly followed. There were some people in the 陳文起 Chin Mun Hi <i>Chen Wen Qi</i> branch who used 文 Mun <i>Wen </i> instead of 德 Ak <i>De</i> for the 23rd generation. This word came from the generation poem, used by the 陳文振 Chen Mun Jin <i>Chen Wen Zhen</i> branch, 陳謨 Chen Mo’s second son. This branch's generation poem starting at the 13th generation is 藉鳳毓嘉秀。 和敬發賢良。 文明應顯達。 歷世永傳揚。
<i>More to come later.</i>
