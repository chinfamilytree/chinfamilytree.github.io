<div class="ex2"><h3 id="hao">What is a 號 hào?</h3>
<p>
In reference to a name of a person, a 號 hào <i>hào</i> is, in general, a nickname or pseudonym. However in the South, especially in Guangdong Province, it is a "marriage name" or perhaps a better English translation would be "generation name" bestowed upon a groom when he is married and a plaque is placed in the village temple. Henceforth he is known by that name. The general order of a 號 hào <i>hào</i> is the surname, which is always first, followed by two characters, one of which is from the village generation poem and the other character is chosen by an elder, either the groom's father or grandfather, or another village elder.

A generation poem is village-dependent. Our Vong Village 潢村, consisting of five hamlets has its own unique poem. The first 20 characters of the 文起 Mũn Hī branch were written by 陳白沙 (陳獻章) Chen Bai Sha (1428-1500 CE) for 陳謨 Chen Mo’s fourth son 陳文起 Chen Wen Qi starting from the 13th generation through the 32nd generation: 聖文萬世昌。應朝瑞國祥。德業光前遠。遵法永延長。Eminent classical literature will prosper for many generations / In response to an auspicious dynasty and the kindness of a nation. / The honor of moral conduct and achievement will shine into the distant future. / Obeying the law will be protracted forever.
