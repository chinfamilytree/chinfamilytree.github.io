Hi Patrick,

Thank you for the photograph of your grandfather's (全業 Tũn Ngèp) family taken at our village and annotated by your cousin's son 衛棟 Vì Ùng. From your comments of the photograph I understand that:
#1 son is 沃章 Yūk Jëng
#2 daughter-in-law is 李穗長 Lī Xuì Jēng (son #2 沃原 has no photo). I have of photograph of 李穗長 Lī Xuì Jēng taken by me when she was older and is on the family tree.
#3 son is
#4 son is
#5 son is 沃伴 Yūk Bòn
#6 son is 沃旋 Yūk Xũn (wife 新好 Xïn Hāo)
#7 son is 沃其 Yūk Kǐ (Your father)
#8 son is 沃新 Yūk Xïn
#9 son is 沃英 Yūk Yëin

On the Chin Family Tree I have 沃堂
Yūk Hõng as #3 son and 沃伴 Yūk Bòn as #4 son. So one son is missing. He could be #3 or #4. Am I correct?

Who are the other people in the photograph?
