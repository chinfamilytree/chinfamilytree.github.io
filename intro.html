Start looking at the Family Tree by clicking on any of the four indices in the top section above. The <b>English</b> Index is sorted in the order of the English alphabet. The Chinese <b>中文</b> Index is sorted according to the 康熙字典 Kangxi Dictionary (1716 C.E.) order using radicals and stroke counts. The Hoisanva <b>台山話拼音</b> Index is sorted by using Microsoft Excel with minor changes to group the same characters together. The Pinyin <b>漢語拼音</b> Index is sorted by using Microsoft Excel. All four indices are divided into three sections. The first section includes the most remote ancestors from 黄帝 <i>Huángdì</i> down to 謨 <i>Mó</i>. The first section is arranged chronologically. The second section includes all Chin (Chan, Chen, Chinn, Chun, Tan, Tran and other variations in romanization) members whose ancestral village is 潢村 Huang Village. The second section is arranged alphabetically by first name. The third section contains relatives whose surnames are, for the most part, not Chin, Chins listed in the third section are not from 潢村 Huang Village. This section is arranged by surname, then by first name. The main portion displays our family tree. Enjoy!

     	<p class="gene">The first column in all the charts indicates the generation number and generation character, if any. The first number is counting from Huangdi. The second number is counting from Mangong. The third number is counting from Shigong. The fourth number is counting from Mo. The generation character is also given starting with the 13th generation from our Great Ancestor Mo [traditional Chinese: 謨; simplified Chinese: 谟; Hoisanva: Mũ; pinyin: <i>Mó</i>]. When a person has a generation name or "married name" (prefixed with or without 號), the personal name is shown in brackets or prefixed with 名. <a href="12-2zhongqian.html"> Generation poems</a> were established for our branch of our family starting from the 13th generation.</p>
