</ul>
<h4>Instructional Procedures </h4>
<p>Each class will begin by a roll call followed by a brief  review of the previous lesson in which students are encouraged to ask  questions. Following the review will be a lecture and a demonstration of new  skills. Students are encouraged to follow the demonstration with their  computers to obtain practical skills. Students are also encouraged to take  advantage of free tutoring provided by the Academic Skills Center in Room A608B  or call 212.217.4080.</p>
<h4>Course Requirements </h4>
<p>There are eight (8) required homework assignments and one  extensive final project.</p>
<h4>Evaluation of students - Methods of assessment </h4>
<p>Each homework assignment is due at the beginning of the class when the class next meets. The instructor will check each student's homework. Late submissions are not credited. Each homework assignment is worth 7% of the final grade. Thus all the homework assignments will be a total of 56% of the final grade. The other 44% is a comprehensive final project. The student may use Dreamweaver and/or HTML/CSS (using a simple text processor, such as Notepad or TextEdit)  to construct his/her final project.   The entire site must be under 8 MB. The project must not contain any of the instructor's demo lists, sounds, or images.</p>
<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>Homework is worth 56% of the final grade and the comprehensive final project is worth 44% of the final grade. There is no extra credit for extra work. There are no exceptions to these rules.</p>
<h4>Attendance Policy </h4>
<p>Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. Students who come in later than 25 minutes after the class started will be marked absent.<br />
3 unexcused latenesses = one absence <br />
3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-)<br />
More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.
</p>
<h4>Late work and missed exams or presentations </h4>
<p>Homework  assignments must be handed in on time to be credited. If the student does not  submit the final project according to specifications at the beginning of the last  session of class, the student, in good standing, will be given the opportunity to submit it no  later than the fifth week of the following semester. A grade of &ldquo;IN&rdquo;  (with student's concordance)  will be submitted for this semester if the student is in <em>good</em> standing, that is, that all homework assignments have been completed, no  excessive unexcused tardiness or unexcused absences. Otherwise, a student will be given a failing grade.</p>
<h4>Critiques</h4>
<p>When the  instructor is checking homework, the student is encouraged to ask questions, if  any, concerning the homework.</p>
<h4>List of Materials </h4>
<p>Every student at FIT has access to  Google Drive connected with FIT. If you have an independent Google account, you have access to an additional cloud drive with 15 GB for free. Microsoft also offers a free cloud drive, called  <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_top">OneDrive</a> [ https://onedrive.live.com/ ], also 15 GB  of storage. These cloud drives are for storage only. They cannot be used as you would a hard drive or flash drive, i.e., you cannot &quot;save&quot; to a cloud drive. You can only upload to it or download from it.</p>
<h4>Lab Hours</h4>
<p>Additional lab hours are available in the Library, CC15, CC15A and C220   if these labs are not being used for instructional purposes.</p>
<h4>Attentiveness</h4>
<p>Be sure to be very attentive to our lesson materials and don't hesitate to stop me at any point during my lecture if you have any questions.</p>
<h4>Contract between Student and Instructor</h4>
<p>After we have gone over the material above,   the student must e-mail the instructor at [ gene_chin@fitnyc.edu ] and state the  following (use &quot;Contract&quot; as the subject):<br />
<blockquote>
  <p><b>I, </b><sub style="color:red;">given name then last namel</sub><b>, of CG214-</b><sub style="color:red;">section</sub><b>, on this day, </b><sub style="color:red;">date in Mm....m dd, yyyy format</sub><b> understand the policies outlined in the Course Syllabus of CG214.</b></p></blockquote>
