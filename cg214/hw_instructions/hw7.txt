Insert the waterhouse.jpg image into index.html immediately after the 
nested ordered list (C. Vitals) and before the paragraph "John William Waterhouse".

Open waterhouse.jpg in Photoshop to find the coordinates for the
three hotspots: a circle for his eye, a polygon for his ear, and
a rectangle on his forehead.
	In Photoshop...	Window/Info
	In Info make sure the cross in the X: Y: section shows pixels.
	Move your mouse to the center of his left eye, note the X and Y 
		coordinates, such as 93, 78.
	To get the radius for the circle, move your mouse straight to
		the right and note the X coordinate, such as 102.
	Subtract 93 from 102 to get 9. This is the radius.
	So the coordinates are written as 93, 78, 9.
	
	For the rectangle you need to know the coordinates of the upper
		left corner and the lower right corner, such as 64,49,103,64.
		
	For a polygon you need to know coordinates of each vertex, such as
		129,69,139,87,129,97,123,84
		Each pair of numbers specifies a vertex, so in this case,
			there are 4 vertices.
		
	For all this to work we need to specify the image and the map 
		associated with the image by means of a name attribute...
		The name in the following case is "Map".
		
	<img src="../homework/hw7/waterhouse.jpg" alt="JWW" title="John William Waterhouse"
		width="180" height="287" usemap="#Map">
			
		
	The three areas used as hot spots enclosed in the map element are
		as follows...
	
	<map name="Map">
        <area shape="circle" coords="93,78,9" href="../homework/hw7/ophelia.html" alt="left eye" title="Left Eye">
        <area shape="poly" coords="129,69,139,87,129,97,123,84" href="../homework/hw7/prelude10-chopin.mp3" alt="left ear" title="Left Ear">
        <area shape="rect" coords="64,49,103,64" href="../homework/hw7/checklist.html" alt="forehead" title="Forehead">
    </map>
	
	We also give each area a "title" so that when the mouse rolls over it,
		the title will show.
	When you click on the hotspot, the link is shown in the href attribute.

For the rollovers we will use the two thumbnails, ophelia-t.jpg and spring-t.jpg...

For the ophelia rollover...

Replace the line... 
<img src="../homework/hw7/ophelia-t.jpg" width="80" height="120" alt="ophelia-t" title="ophelia-t">

with...
<a href="../homework/hw7/ophelia.jpg" target="if1"
onmouseover="document.ophi.src='ophelia-r.jpg'" 
onmouseout= "document.ophi.src='ophelia-t.jpg'">
<img src="../homework/hw7/ophelia-t.jpg" name="ophi" alt="ophelia" title="Ophelia"> 
</a>

For the spring rollover...

Replace the line... 
<img src="../homework/hw7/spring-t.jpg" width="80" height="120" alt="spring-t" title="spring-t">

with...
<a href="../homework/hw7/spring.jpg" target="if1"
onmouseover="document.spr.src='spring-r.jpg'" 
onmouseout= "document.spr.src='spring-t.jpg'">
<img src="../homework/hw7/spring-t.jpg" name="spr" alt="spring" title="Spring"> 
</a>
