   <h4 id="Genesis">Genesis</h4>
<p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the 
face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the 
waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from 
the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. 
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

<p>And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, 
in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of 
the second month, in the second year after they were come 
out of the land of Egypt, saying, Take ye the sum of all the 
congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, 
by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, 
every male by their polls; From twenty years old and upward, 
all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and 
Aaron shall number them by their armies.

<p>These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on 
this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain 
over against the Red sea, between Paran and Tophel, 
and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
